        <h1>Air Quality Impact</h1>
        <h2>Rising Dust and Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            As the Salton Sea continues to shrink, vast areas of the lakebed are exposed, releasing toxic dust into the air. This dust contains harmful chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals that contribute to serious health issues for nearby communities in the Imperial Valley of California, and some parts of Southern Arizona and Mexico. The communites often have higher asthma rates when compared to other communities and counties in the United States.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Health Effects on Residents</h2>
        <p>
            Poor air quality in the region has a tremendous impact on the air that these communities breath. Children and elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to these airborne pollutants and are at increased risk for asthma and other respiratory diseases. Just going outside in these regions puts individuals at increased risk, because of the ecological conditions of the area. It is like living in a dust bowl, but there is not only dust, there is pesticides, salt, and other toxic particles in the air.
        </p>

        <h2>Efforts to Improve Air Quality</h2>
        <p>
            The State of California is working to mitigate the impact by restoring portions of the lake, planting vegetation to reduce dust, and monitoring air quality levels. A notable restoration effort involves placing haybales across the expsoed lake bed, which helps keep dust from spreading and floating with wind. However, challenges remain due to funding, climate change, and continued water conservation efforts across California and Arizona.
