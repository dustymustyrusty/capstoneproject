            The Salton Sea is one of California’s most notorious bodies of water, created during an engineering accident, but now a critical to the region’s ecosystem. It has begun facing a steep decline the last 4 decades since the 80s, affecting wildlife and local communities. Efforts to restore and preserve the sea continue, but challenges remain. The lakebed which continues to dry up at an alarming rate will continue to have massive impacts on the region and neighboring regions air quality,especially with sandstorms.

            With air quality concerns, water loss, and increasing salinity, the Salton Sea’s future is uncertain. This site aims to bring awareness to the ecological issues that face the sea, and the impacts the degradation of the sea has on the ecosystem and communites around it.
